# EEG-Motor-Imagery-Analysis
This repository belongs to my implementations during my **B.Sc. Thesis**. The main title was _Applications of Deep Neural Networks in EEG Signal Analysis_. After an article review, we decided to work on _Motor Imagery EEG Signals_.

The dataset we used is [BCI Competition IV 2a](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/). We implemented several state-of-the-art methods in the literature with some modifications. We also took some ideas from outside of the motor imagery literature.

Preprocessing steps are done using `numpy` and `scipy`. Deep learning models are their training are implemented using `pytorch`.
